## Abstract

Inference of evolutionary trees 

### **Biological setup:** 
 

### **Computational setup:** 


### Background

Mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance (MSAI). This is from a work from the tracerX project [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1616288]. The idea is that in some subclones only maternal and in others only paternal chromosomal regions are inherited. 

The ASCAT tool is used for LogR and BAF values for the MSAI.

*How can these events be accounted for in a phylogenetic tree?*
