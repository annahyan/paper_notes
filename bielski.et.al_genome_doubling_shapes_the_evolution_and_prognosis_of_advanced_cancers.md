# Genome doubling shapes the evolution and prognosis of advanced cancers

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0165-1

## Abstract

### **Biological setup:** 

* 9692 tumors from MSKCC sequenced with three versions of MSK-IMPACT assays (containing 341, 410, and 468 genes respectively)
 

### **Computational setup:** 



### **Results:** 

A huge proportion of tumors with WGD carry a TP53 mutation.

The results show that TP53 and other oncogenic mutations precede the WGD event.

*How can the timing order between WGD and a mutation be determined?*

*How is the proliferative index calculated?*
