## Preleukemic clonal evolution revealed using single-cell DNA sequencing and computational modeling

[https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.15.571872](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.15.571872v1)

### Abstract

**Biological setup:** Preleukemic HSCs (pHSC) from 16 AML patients. scDNA sequencing

*How were the pHSCs defined?*

**Computational setup:** Patient-wise **phylogenetic trees** from somatic variants. Simulation and machine learning to model somatic evolution.

*What kind of simulations and machine learning exactly?*

**Results:** Quantification of selection. The variation in the trees can be inferred from the model.

### Most relevant parts for me

1. pHSC selection
2. The scDNA-seq analysis
3. Modeling of the AML
4. How exactly was the Machine learning used
5. What do we read from the phylogenetic trees?
